 Exercise 1 of 6


## Task

Write a function that takes an argument and returns that argument.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS

To make a Node.js program, create a new file with a .js extension and start
writing JavaScript! Execute your program by running it with the node command.

For example:

    $ node program.js

Writing functions that are available to the outside world is different in Node.
